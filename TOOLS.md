# 🛠️ Editor Tools Overview

This folder will eventually host standalone editor scripts and utilities created during development of the Non-Generic-Zombie-Game project.

These tools include:
- Item validator and auto-sprite repairer
- Asset labelers and category mapping
- Serialization ghost cleaner
- Prefab and scene hygiene scans

The goal is to release these scripts under an open-source license (e.g. MIT)  
once they’re stable, documented, and fully decoupled from game logic.

Until then, all contents are covered by the Custom Solo Dev License.  
Do not reuse or redistribute any scripts from this folder unless permission is granted or an open-source tag is added.

**Status:** Tooling is currently internal-use only  
**Future License:** MIT (planned for stable release)
