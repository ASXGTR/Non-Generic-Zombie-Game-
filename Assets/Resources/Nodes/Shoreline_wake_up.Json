You slowly push yourself up and sit. The salty air burns your throat.\n\nYou're on a shoreline, but nothing looks familiar. The beach is empty. No boats. No birds. Just wreckage. You check yourself—torn jeans, a soaked T-shirt, a glowstick dangling from a cord around your neck. In your pocket, a bruised piece of fruit. A strip of cloth is tied to your arm.\n\nYou're shivering.\n\nYou don’t remember how you got here.\n\nSomething is wrong.",
